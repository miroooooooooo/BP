# 🚗 Autonomous Car

Welcome to the repository of my Bachelor Thesis, where I have designed and implemented an autonomous car control system using neuro evolution techniques in MATLAB. 
The core of the system uses neural networks evolved through genetic algorithms to drive the car based on various sensor inputs.
